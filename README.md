Challenge 1 - Refactoring

I was given starter code and the following user story and acceptance criteria:

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Actions Taken
1. Added the following semantic elements in HTML for easier navigation including:
    header, image, section, article, aside, footer
2. Changed title from Website to Horiseon Social Solution Services to more accurately describe content
3. Add alt image descriptions
4. Simplified CSS and added notes
